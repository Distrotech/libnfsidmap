2004-09-16: add debian stuff to dist tarball
2004-12-16:
conf_path is defined as a global in cfg.c.  Use that one here.
2006-02-24:
- Changes originally from Steve Dickson to fix library logging and debugging.
Add externally visible routine to set debugging level and logging routine.
Change all warnx() calls to use new IDMAP_LOG macro.
- In the umich_ldap code, move calls to ldap_init() and ldap_bind() into
a subroutine.  Don't do a bind since it isn't necessary for LDAPv3.
- Change libtool versioning to reflect interface change.
2006-02-24:
Don't use Verbosity from config file.
2006-03-21:
- Properly detect error returns from getpwnam_r() and handle them.

- Parse and use the "Nobody-User" and "Nobody-Group" entries from the
idmapd.conf file.

- If a translation fails, always attempt to return information for
the "nobody" user or group (as defined above).

- Add changes from Daniel Wachdorf <drwachd@sandia.gov>.
These changes in the umich_ldap code:
- allow configurable parameters to map objectclass names and attribute names
- allow configurable use of SLL to connect to the LDAP server
- allow configuration of a user DN and password to do an authenticated
bind to the LDAP server.

NOTE: These changes change the way to define an alternate subtree
to search for People and Group objects.  A full DN should be specified
for "LDAP_people_base" or "LDAP_group_base".  The *_subtree options
are no longer used.

- Add an example idmapd.conf file to the distribution (original from Dan).

- Minor updates to the libtest program, which is now included in the
distribution.
2006-04-20:
Don't do "nobody" mapping in the library.  Return -ENOENT if unable
to do the requested mapping.  Caller can then take the appropriate
action regarding the mapping failure.
2006-09-05:
Patch from Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>, to allow libnfsidmap
to be built without requiring ldap.
2006-11-02:
Patch from Glenn Machin <GMachin@sandia.gov> to honor the buffer
size in umich_id_to_name() before copying name into buffer.

Fix a few memory leaks.
